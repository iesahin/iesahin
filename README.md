### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I began programming with Atari BASIC in a time when there was no internet.

Currently I'm working in Rust, Ruby and Python, with MLOps and LegalOps as my main focus.

Currently developing [xvc](https://github.com/iesahin/xvc) and its Python bindings [xvc-py](https://github.com/iesahin/xvc-py).
