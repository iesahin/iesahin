### Hi fellow developers ðŸ‘‹

I'm Emre, a software engineer with a background in Machine Learning, Computer
Vision.

These days I'm working in Rust, Ruby and Python, applying LLMs to help lawyers
for their contracts and legal documents. I'm also developing an open source
project called [Xvc] and its [bindings] to manage large data and deep pipelines
for Machine Learning projects.

I worked with various technologies and languages in the past. I developed real
time face recognition software with Torch, built web servers in Go, wrote Video
OCR for Arabic in Tensorflow, etc. The earliest project I wrote for daily use
was a customized editor for Notary offices in Delphi in late 1990s. The
earliest language I used was Atari BASIC in early 1990s. I taught C to myself
in one week, graduated from my department with the highest GPA, dropped out of
Ph.D twice and still learning how to live this life as a flawed human being.
