### Hi fellow developers ðŸ‘‹

I'm Emre, a software engineer with a background in Machine Learning and
Computer Vision.

These days I'm working in Rust, Ruby and Python, applying LLMs to help lawyers
for their contracts and legal documents. I'm also developing an open source
project called [Xvc], its [docs](https://docs.xvc.dev) and its Python
[bindings] to manage large data and deep pipelines for Machine Learning
projects. Install it with `cargo install xvc` for CLI and `pip install xvc` for
Python. You can star its [repo](https://github.com/iesahin/xvc) or visit its
[site](https://xvc.dev) time to time for updates.

I worked with various technologies and languages in the past. I developed [real
time face recognition software](https://github.com/iesahin/facebin) with Torch
and Redis, built web servers in Go, wrote Video OCR for Arabic in Tensorflow,
etc. The earliest project I wrote for daily use was a customized editor for
Notary offices in Delphi in late 1990s. The earliest language I used was Atari
BASIC in early 1990s. I taught C to myself in one pleasurable week when I was
in high school, graduated from my department with the highest GPA, dropped out
of Ph.D twice and still learning how to live this life as a flawed human being.
I write my technical posts in [emresahin.net](https://emresahin.net) and
non-technical posts (mostly in Turkish) in [nedriyat](https://nedriy.at).
